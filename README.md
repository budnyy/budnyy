🙋‍♂️ I'm Arthur Budny, a backend developer currently living in Brazil.

☕ Lately I've been learning **Java/Spring Boot** and developing personal projects (apart from dealing with college assignments), but I love discovering new technologies.

🛠️ My last project was [financectrl](https://github.com/budnyy/financectrl), a website to keep up with your expenses, featuring CSV exporting for external software (e.g. Excel).

📫 Feel free to contact me through my [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/arthur-vaz-budny-3a9387360/) or through my email: budnyarthur@gmail.com
